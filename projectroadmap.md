**Goal: Initial Setup and Exploration**

[x] **Task 1: Search for related inventory tracking repositories on GitHub and evaluate their features.**
Details: Find at least 2 repositories related to inventory management or stock tracking. Analyze their functionality, noting strengths, weaknesses, and any features that could be useful.

[x] **Task 2: Clone and test one repository.**
Details: Clone a selected repository, set it up, and run it. Document any setup issues encountered and solutions.

[x] **Task 3: Create initial project structure in a new GitHub repository.**
Details: Create folders for src, tests, and docs. Include a basic Python file (main.py) with a placeholder function for starting the project.

[x] **Task 4: Implement a basic add-item feature.**
Details: Develop a simple function to add items to inventory with dummy data (e.g., item name, quantity).

[x] **Task 5: Document project setup and usage in the README.**
Details: Write installation instructions and basic usage notes in the README.md file.
